# QuantumCatYT

In 2016, I was introduced to the world of programming and very quickly fell in love with it- making Discord bots and game engines, I rapidly self-taught C#. I went on to create, what was at one point in time, one of the largest Discord bots in the world, hosted in over 40,000 servers and used by hundreds of thousands of people around the globe.

Today, I work mostly on *Weeklies*, a challenge where I attempt to make a full game in just one week, every week throughout 2023.

Most of my work is closed-source, but I am happy to show any source to a recruiter.
